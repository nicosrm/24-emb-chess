# Embedded Chess Pieces

This repository is a fork of [`dezibot/dezibot`](https://github.com/dezibot/dezibot). and contains our project for the module C999.1 "Software Development for Embedded Systems" lectured by [Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Jens Wagner](https://fim.htwk-leipzig.de/fakultaet/personen/professorinnen-und-professoren/jens-wagner/). We call it *Embedded Chess Pieces*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The project is still under development. This note will be removed once the project is submitted.


## Idea

The idea is to place a Dezibot 4 on a chess board and assign a chess piece to it. The user can select which piece the robot represents and how it should move. The selected figure shall be displayed on the built-in display and the move shall be validated first. The result should be shown via the built-in LEDs. If there is time, the moves shall be communicated wirelessly.


## Repository Structure

This repository is a fork of [`dezibot/dezibot`](https://github.com/dezibot/dezibot). Changes to the `Dezibot` library are made directly where necessary. Our main contribution – the `EmbeddedChessPieces` library -- is stored in [example/EmbeddedChessPieces/](./example/EmbeddedChessPieces/). It includes project specific code that is not generally sensible to add to the Dezibot library.

In [`example/EmbeddedChessPieces/examples`](./example/EmbeddedChessPieces/examples/) you can find tests and example use cases for our project. This includes Arduino sketches we developed to test our library developments as well as the heart of this project – the code to run our project.

## Usage

- Install [Arduino IDE 2](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide)
- Add [`esp32`](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/releases/tag/2.0.15) board manager by Espressif Systems (version 2.0.15)
- Install all necessary libraries mentioned under [Licence](#licence)
- Create a symbolic link from this repository and the `EmbeddedChessPieces` library to the Arduino library directory on your machine

```sh
$ cd /path/to/Arduino/library
$ ln -s /path/to/24-emb-chess Dezibot
$ ln -s /path/to/24-emb-chess/example/EmbeddedChessPieces/src EmbeddedChessPieces
```
